Update: 07/23/2010<br /><br />I tweeted a link to this ranty post out to <a href="http://twitter.com/chaptersindigo">@chaptersindigo</a>&nbsp;and got this back today from <a href="http://twitter.com/indigo_renee">@indigo_renee</a><br /><br /><blockquote>"@phro Tx for the suggestions. Some of your concerns are definitely on our development roadmap. Others, I'll look into. @chaptersindigo"</blockquote>Thanks guys! I'm looking forward to&nbsp;checking out what you cook up.<br /><br /><hr /><br />Aside from creative curse words, liver damage, and extra pounds, the only other thing I've had a long term interest in collecting is books. &nbsp;Which is to say that <i>besides</i> being an avid reader I am also an avid book buyer. &nbsp;I think libraries have their place, for research, and for folks who are big readers for the sake of reading. &nbsp;But me, I love reading and I love books besides. &nbsp;I almost always read with a notepad and pen beside me, and I love taking a highlighter to my favourite passages. &nbsp;To me the book, like the computer, is a tool that can (and should!) be personalized for maximum throughput.<br /><br />I say all that to say, I buy a lot of books. &nbsp;A regular payday treat for me is to stop by a bookstore on the way home. &nbsp;I re-buy books I already own so I can give away copies without depleting my stash. &nbsp;On my desktop computer at work, home, on my cell phone, and on my nightstand are lists labelled "things to read", and I'll probably buy them all.<br /><br />When I started using <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/">Chapters/Indigo's site</a> to order stuff they didn't stock in stores I also began using their wishlist feature as a way to consolidate all these disparate lists into one sane place; namely, where the books are. In so doing, by extension I started keeping a list of things that could be better on the Chapters/Indigo site, which for some reason they do not have a place for on their site so I'll put it here.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">1. How about a suggestions page?</span><br /><br />Why do I have to put this list on my blog? &nbsp;Chapters are you really so disinterested in how customers think you could improve? <br /><br />Yes I see there is a "contact us" form, how very 90's, but it appears to be entirely customer service related. &nbsp;Something more obvious would be better. &nbsp;Don't make it difficult for people to try to help you. &nbsp;That should be a rule in business and life in general.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">2. Disappearing features stink.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Self-Insight-Roadblocks-Detours-Path-David-Dunning/9781841690742-item.html">Some books</a> cannot be added to the wishlist for no apparent reason at all. &nbsp;That book I linked is currently "Temporarily Unavailable to Order New". &nbsp;Does that mean I should <i>just stop wishing?</i>&nbsp;Say it ain't so!<br /><br />The current availability of a product has absolutely no bearing on my desire to have that product at some point in the future. &nbsp;Plus there is quality customer data to be had there regarding demand, data that could be used to encourage publishers that a reprint is in order. &nbsp;All that valuable data is being silently ignored while simultaneously removing functionality for the user.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">3. Do you know who I am?</span><br /><br />This weekend my dad and I snooped around the Festival Hall Chapters on John street and we picked up a few titles, one of which was an item from my wishlist. &nbsp;I purchased that book with the same debit and irewards cards I use to buy books online, yet when I logged in to the site a couple days later I had to remove the title from my wishlist by hand. <br /><br />All the necessary data to take care of this without my help is right there to be used. &nbsp;Even if the next time I sign in it just asks me "Hey, we noticed you bought this, should we take it off your wish list for you?", that's fine. &nbsp;Those precious seconds of user attention being wasted on something that ought to be automatic could be better used promoting products.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">4. Do you know who that guy is?</span><br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2010/06/chapters.search.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/content/images/2010/06/chapters.search.png" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When I search for the author of my currently-unavailable-yet-wished-for book I discover that David Dunning is a popular name among authors. &nbsp;No problem, I figure my guy isn't writing about managing a dental practice so I click on the David Dunning below and something bizarre happens, it just searches for the guys name again. &nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">That link may as well be labelled "waste our bandwidth, waste your bandwidth, and waste some time", or more plainly "reload". &nbsp;Chapters, please talk to a DBA and see about getting a unique key on your authors database table so when clicked it does what a user would expect and limits search results to the David Dunning they're interested in.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">5. Coffee?</span></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">While scouring the site looking for a suggestion page I discovered that I pass the Chapters/Indigo home offices on my way to and from work every day. &nbsp;If somebody over there reads this and would like to chat by all means get in touch.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You're buying :)</div>
