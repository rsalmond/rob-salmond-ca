It's been pretty quiet here lately, but not for a lack of writing. I've been spending some time trying my hand at short / flash speculative&nbsp;fiction on a seperate blog I created for just that purpose. It's mostly nerdy and mostly crime related and mostly just for fun.&nbsp;If that sounds like your sort of thing, by all means <a href="http://nearlynow.blogspot.com/">stop by</a>.
