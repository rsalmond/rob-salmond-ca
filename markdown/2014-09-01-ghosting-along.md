Just took the old blog out behind the datacenter and put it down, served me well but it was in a lot of pain so this was really for the best. Ghost still seems like a good move. I wouldn't say I'm starting to get the hang of Node or anything that drastic but it no longer fills me with the rage of a thousand suns so that's a step in the right direction.

As well as moving my bits around the internet, I recently moved my home as well. Actually I took the easy way out and just started reffering to a new building as "home". Lazy I know but much less paperwork. I'm in North Van now, nice view up here.
