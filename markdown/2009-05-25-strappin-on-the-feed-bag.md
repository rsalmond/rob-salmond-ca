I had a couple of people mention to me that phrostuff was loading pretty slow for them in IE. I took a look and I must say, there was quite a bit of lag. I did some testing with CURL and discovered there didn't seem to be any lag in retrieving the HTML, but IE seemed to be chunking pretty hard trying to parse it.<br /><br />I did some fiddling and discovered this was due to my massive blogroll widget which I recently upgraded from a javascript based version to the official Blogger widget which allows the blogs I list to receive some link-lovin-<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice">google-juice</a> for my patronage.<br /><br />If you're interested in following some of the feeds I read regularly, the most recently updated 25 will always be visible in the sidebar and you can see the rest by scrolling to the bottom and hitting Show All.
