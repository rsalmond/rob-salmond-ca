A naive young brunette is drinking imported beer and jotting down a few words in a journal at my local dive the other night when a greasy guy ten years her senior sits down next to her and they begin to talk.  I catch snips of wide eyed liberal, second-year-of-college type chatter when the conversation turns to vegans.<div><br /></div><div>her: Oh yes I <span style="font-style: italic;">am </span>a vegan!  How did you guess?</div><div><br /></div><div>him: Just a hunch I suppose.  I heard a funny story about a vegan PETA lobbyist who was trying to get Ben &amp; Jerry's to stop using cow milk in their ice cream.  He said to them, "would you subject human mothers to the kind of treatment the cows who provide your milk receive"?</div><div><br /></div><div>her: *giggles*</div><div><br /></div><div>him: Well the Ben &amp; Jerry's people said, "But breast milk is for baby's, it's an unfair comparison."  So the lobbyist simply replied, "you're right, and cow milk should be for baby cows."</div><div><br /></div><div>her (completely serious): Wow, so what happened?  Did they start using breast milk instead?</div><div><br /></div><div>me: Bartender, another double over here.</div>
