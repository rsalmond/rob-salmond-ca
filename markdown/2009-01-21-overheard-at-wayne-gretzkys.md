Wayne has a restaraunt about a block away from my office on Blue Jays Way near the Diesel Playhouse.  Being that it's the closest licenced lunch spot to work, I often find myself killing noon hour (and the hour after that) at Wayne's with Toronto's best bartender Gus.  Last week I overheard this conversation between a man and what appeared to be his (roughly) eleven year old son.<br /><br />Man: So do you know who Wayne Gretzky is boy?<br />Boy: Umm, didn't he play for the Leafs or something?<br />Man: *sigh* Close enough.<br /><br />True story.
