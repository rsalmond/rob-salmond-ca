Someone told me recently that more people go out for drinks on Paddy's than for New Years Eve. I guess there's probably a corresponding increase in green vomit in March as well ... but who can be sure? Of course like any good night of alcohol induced shenanigans theres the discovery of mysterious aches and bruises you can't remember earning, crumpled bar paraphernalia found stuffed in pockets, fivers, bashed smokes, scrawled ramblings on a napkin and blurry nonsensical pictures on your cell phone ...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2007/03/robot.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/content/images/2007/03/robot.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5043401244155274498" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"drop your weapon, you have 15 seconds to comply ..."<br /><br /></span><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Finally comes the constant and increasingly elaborate retelling of the events of the night in question.  Oh spare us the details ye bards and yarn spinners, if you can remember that much it can't have been that a good Paddy's night anyway.<br /><br /></div></div>
