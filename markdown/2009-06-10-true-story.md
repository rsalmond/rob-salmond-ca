I was perusing some old PA cartoons today and stumbled across this gem.<br /><br /><a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/12/20/"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345758269208879234" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 194px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="/content/images/2009/06/19991220h.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />It reminded me of when I was living just across town from my mother and kid brothers a few years back, I'd often have my little brothers crash over on a weekend to stay up late and watch movies that mom doesn't approve of. What follows is as near to verbatim as I can recall ...<br /><br />Vince (youngest brother, around 9 at the time): Cool you got Grand Theft Auto? Can I play it??<br /><br />Me: Erm, sure but you CAN'T tell mom okay? If she asks, we were playing WipeoutXL right?<br /><br />Vince: Right!<br /><br />*the next day mom stops by to grab Vince*<br /><br />Mom: Hi guys! Did you have fun Vinny?<br /><br />Vince: MOM! I beat up a hooker with a baseball bat and took all her money!<br /><br />Mom: *looks about as impressed as you'd expect*<br /><br />Me: *facepalm*
