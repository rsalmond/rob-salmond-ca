Guy One: This week, I had like ten people add me on Facebook and I don't know a single one of them.<br />Guy Two: I know!  Today I wanted to delete Matt, but if I did that I'd have to delete like three other people.<br />Guy One: (laughing) I just did a cleanup on the weekend, I deleted everyone from my home town!<br />Guy Two: (admits quietly) I deleted everyone from high school.<br />Me: lulz.
