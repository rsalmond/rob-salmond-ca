I had to install a Microsoft OS recently so I could get remote access to work. &nbsp;That being the case I got some Windows 7 action going and for the most part, I don't hate it. &nbsp;It's got a couple MS type irritations; having to <a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/08/24/loading-unsigned-drivers-in-windows-7-and-vista-64-bit-x64/">screw</a> <a href="http://www.killertechtips.com/2009/05/06/disable-driver-signing-in-windows-7-using-group-policy-editor/">around</a>&nbsp;to load an unsigned driver was annoying but at least I understand <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-vista/What-is-a-signed-driver">why they did that</a>. &nbsp;What I have yet to understand is the Windows undying devotion to the QWERTY keyboard layout. &nbsp;Yeah it's the most common but there's no shortage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout">alternatives</a>, and while MS seems to understand people want the choice of something else, they also seem to really want users to hang on to QWERTY despite their stated preferences.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2010/12/kbh-stupidity.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/content/images/2010/12/kbh-stupidity.png" /></a></div><br />For reasons I can't explain, no matter how completely I remove the US QWERTY keyboard layout, it still shows up in the language bar. &nbsp;So I hide the language bar, no big deal right? &nbsp;Except no matter how many times I disable the hotkeys for switching input languages I still randomly find the keys switching back to QWERTY under my fingers without warning. &nbsp;I've locked myself out of my VPN access to work twice now and at least one website by&nbsp;unknowingly mistyping passwords when my fingers were hitting what I thought were the right keys but which Windows had shuffled on me.<br /><br />I booted up Ubuntu so I could show a screenshot of how it's done properly, but it seems there is nothing to see. &nbsp;Yeah because when you have only one keyboard layout selected, go figure, the language bar hides itself and the hotkeys disable themselves. <br /><br />I'll update this if I figure out how to fix things, but in the meantime suggestions are welcome.<br /><br />/rant.
