So last night a surprising number of friends decided to join me in ringing in my most recent 365 day stretch on this planet with some Monday night shenanigans.  Fortunately I had today off to recover, but several souls who were likely in as poor shape as I was this morning had to drag themselves to work today and I salute their dedication to the cause!<br /><br />I was also introduced to a new shot I'd never heard of last night by a chum who works with a liquor distributor (shoulda been my first clue) called an "Ironic Tonic".  He brought two clear shots to the the table and placed them in front of me announcing that one was gin, and the other tonic water.  You chase the one with the other but you don't know which is which. <br /><br />"Please let the first one be the gin", I thought as I knocked it down.  Sure enough I found the gin first so I quickly drained the tonic water as my friend started laughing.<br /><br />"The ironic part", he said, "is they were both gin.  Happy birthday buddy".<br /><br />Thanks, ass.  :)
