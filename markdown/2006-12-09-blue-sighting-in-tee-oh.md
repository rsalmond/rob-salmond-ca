Despite pretty much nil time to play and enjoy many games these days, I do like to stay on the up and up with the gaming world.  Among other fountains of gaming knowledge, I usually try to stop for a sip at <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/">BluesNews</a> when I'm making the rounds.  Anyway recently I snapped this pic of some dude eyeballin' me near Nathan Phillips Square and just now it occurred to me how much he looks like Blue.  I'll let you be the judge ...<br /><br /><a href="/content/images/2006/12/bluesighting.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/content/images/2006/12/bluesighting.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5006606534399779250" border="0" /></a><br />But why would he shave the goatee, grow a hawk, and move to Toronto?  He must be on the lam!  Better grab yourself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuque">tuque</a> Blue!  It's damned chilly out there without a full head of insulation ;)
