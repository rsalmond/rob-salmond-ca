Everyone has an opinion about what software to install after refreshing your OS, top x lists abound for the curious.&nbsp; At some point a while back though I realized that after patches and security updates, the first thing I do now is set up my cloud.&nbsp; I re-install all my bookmarklets, re-save all my passwords in my browsers, install notifiers for my services, etc.&nbsp; I recently had the experience of reconnecting my home to the net after we decided to spend some time apart to think about what we really wanted.&nbsp; It's been a couple weeks of sweet thirst quenching digital Tron water at the homestead and while my software is updated to the bleeding edge, my cloud still needs munging.<br /><br />Which I've really spent some time thinking about as I soaked up the <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/one-graph-to-rule-them-all.html">many</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_centralization.php">varied</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/21/facebook/">reactions</a> to facebook's API announcements, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/03/state-of-internet-operating-system.html">Tim's thoughts</a> on the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html">the net as a platform</a>, and then todays&nbsp;<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/diaspora_project_building_the_anti-facebook.php">story on ReadWriteWeb</a>&nbsp;about a group of NYU students building "the anti-facebook". "<a href="http://www.joindiaspora.com/">The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all distributed open source social network</a>". &nbsp;It reminded me of an article I found one day when I googled the title of this post and found <a href="http://blog.fatalerror.in/node/211">this write up from February 2008</a>&nbsp;about using CMS plugins as endpoints for a distributed social network.&nbsp;This seems far closer to the stack based approach to software development that modern computing is founded on, and certainly closer to the <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Don't+fight+the+internet%22">"Don't fight the internet"</a> way of doing things that so many are striving for.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.gorillasushi.com/?q=node/841" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/content/images/2010/05/FWPA.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />Many of the overloaded web apps of today could be unburdoned by self-hosted, finely controlled, open standards based plugins of tomorrow. &nbsp;Now I don't mean to say that things like Gowalla, Facebook, and Twitter should roll over and play dead, they will always have their place. &nbsp;But there is certainly room to fill in the cracks. &nbsp;After all that's what the internet does best, keeping a myriad of disparate computing environments talking through standardized channels.<br /><br />I look forward to the day when I hand someone a business card that simply reads 'phrostuff.ca' and they need only punch that into a smartphone to programmatically friend me, phone me, email me, or check out pics, videos, or <a href="http://blog.freebase.com/2010/04/29/a-freebase-implementation-of-the-facebook-graph-api/">my opinion of The Dark Knight</a> all based on how much I tell my endpoint to share with them.
