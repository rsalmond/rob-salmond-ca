Besides the fact that something cool does seem to happen daily on one sixth the Earth's surface, cool stuff happened there back in the day too. Yesterdays <a href="http://englishrussia.com/?p=612" target="_blank">colour photos</a> circa ~1900 are an interesting glimpse into the past.  I'm pretty sure I failed history but I often find stuff like this fascinating.<br /><br />This photographers stuff washed up on my screen once before when I stumbled onto an LOC archive of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/boundforglory/glory-exhibit.html" target="_blank">middle America</a> a while back.   For more of the Russia series <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/gorskii.html" target="_blank">surf this way</a>.  For a view of Toronto through the way back machine take a look at this unfortunately named but conveniently world readable listing of various <a href="http://gencat.eloquent-systems.com/webcat/systems/toronto.arch/resource/" target="_blank">city archive photos</a>.  For less sifting and more detail there are more <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/archives/" target="_blank">conventional sites</a>.<br /><br />Anyway <a href="http://englishrussia.com/" target="_blank">English Russia</a> is great stuff, read early, and read often.  In my suggested reading department I've re-tuned my sidebar from dugg stories to shared items in Google Reader.  Hopefully this will provide a more interesting overview of what I'm eyeballing these days. For the rest of the stuff I try to read consistently see my <a href="http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=5769" target="_blank">OPML</a> (c'mon 'blogroll' just sounds stupid).
