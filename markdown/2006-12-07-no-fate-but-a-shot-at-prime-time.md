The Stand, Mad Max, and (thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feargus_Urquhart" target="_blank"><span>Feargus</span></a>!) the <a href="http://www.nma-fallout.com/">Fallout</a> <span>RPGs</span> are among my most enjoyed childhood stories.  Both my parents were pretty strongly opposed to graphic violence in anything I was watching or reading, but seemed quite happy to provide me with any dark or ominous story elements I showed interest in.  So my strong affinity for all things detrimental to humankind on a massive scale such as <a href="http://www.everybody-dies.com/" target="_blank">global thermonuclear war</a>, any number of <a href="http://www.regenesistv.com/indexframeset.html" target="_blank">virulent</a> <a href="http://www.28dayslaterthemovie.co.uk/" target="_blank">infectious agents</a>, and of course technology that's just <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">out to get us</span></a> grew as I did.<br /><br />Now today I've heard that the virtually unstoppable robots from the future are coming to the small screen in the form of "<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i4e2055a0ae81a8525f43883c93e41767" target="_blank">The Sarah Conner Chronicles</a>".  The primary writer is listed as Josh Friedman whose writing credits include the recent "War of the Worlds" remake and the sci-<span>fi</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">disaster</span> "Chain Reaction", so I'm really not getting my hopes up.  Add to that the fact that while Lena <span>Headey</span> is supposed to be pretty good in <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank">300</a>, and may do fine as Sarah Conner, she wouldn't last five minutes against Linda Hamilton if they did battle in <span>Thunderdome</span>.<br /><br /><span>Don't</span>' get me wrong though, I still plan to tune the torrent watching <span>rss</span> feeds in preparation for premiere night and will post more when I can.
