So the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/12/10/femto-cellular" target="_blank">word today</a> is that wireless providers are going to offer <a href="http://www.ipaccess.com/products/femto3G.htm" target="_blank">cell base stations</a> for the home or office which connect to their voice networks via your broadband connection ... for a moderate fee.  Despite any mention of a specific carrier or a time frame for this upcoming offering there seems to be some <a href="http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2006/12/10/get-a-femto-cell-for-mobile-phone-dead-zones" target="_blank">moderate</a> <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/12/014325.htm" target="_blank">interest</a>.  I gotta say I'm interested to see how it plays it should they decide to try it.   With the the likes of skype, gtalk, and askterisk growing steadily and becoming <a href="http://www.asterisknow.org/" target="_blank">easier to use</a> I can see this becoming a commodity hardware offering that would allow people to become their own cell providers.  What's next, GNU cellular service?  How about a <a href="http://en.fon.com/" target="_blank">FON</a> style community of "Social Routers" for wireless and cellular communication?<br /><br />Hey Rogers, we're coming to get you!
