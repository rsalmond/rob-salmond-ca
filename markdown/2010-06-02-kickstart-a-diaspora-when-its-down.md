<span style="font-family: Arial;">Like <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=diaspora">a lot of people</a>, when I caught wind of the <a href="http://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a> project I decided to ante up and see what some <a href="http://www.latfh.com/">hipster lookin'</a> kids from NYU could do about taking the suck out of Facebook. &nbsp;I'd never used <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> before, the platform they used to collect digital alms to fund their work so I bought a temporary Visa card and put ten bucks in their coffer looking forward to seeing how it all turned out. &nbsp;Then I got distracted and wandered off to spend the rest of my temporary Visa on stupid shirts and other internet foolishness.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fast forward to today, the end of their fundraising period. &nbsp;Which apparently Kickstarter waits for before they actually try to charge your card, so of course now that my <a href="http://www.pennyarcademerch.com/pat090011.html">sweet geometry apparel</a>&nbsp;is paid for and en route, my donation got declined. &nbsp;So now I'm the asshole who jerks the rug out from under these guys to the tune of TEN DOLLARS! &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;">We're talking <i>tens of dozens of cents</i> here people.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay so it's not a big deal, but seriously I can't be the only one who had this happen. &nbsp;Maybe it never occurred to them that someone might not implicitly trust them from the get go? C'mon Kickstarter, get yer head in the game.</span></div>
