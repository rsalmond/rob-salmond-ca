So somehow my poorly disfigured kid brother got his self married just a couple weeks ago to a bonafied woman, and a cute one at that! Not only did he pull off a marriage, but somehow both my parents, my brother, his wife, and I held still long enough for one of these so called "digital cameras" to capture our image into silicon history. So for posterity sake, behold this image of a grinning family under a Canadian sun. Good times for all, and I couldn't have been happier anywhere else.<br /><a href="/content/images/2008/09/PIC_0126.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/content/images/2008/09/PIC_0126.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5247600915813511522" border="0" /></a>
