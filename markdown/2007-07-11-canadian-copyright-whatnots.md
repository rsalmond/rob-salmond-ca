Some ripples in the Canadian copyright pond lately.  Last week <a href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_blank">RMS</a> was at <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/361.0.html?&amp;tx_mininews_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=1895&amp;tx_mininews_pi1%5BbackPid%5D=51&amp;cHash=110471a7f6" target="_blank">U of T</a> and <a href="http://atuw.ca/reminder-stallman-lecture-this-afternoon/" target="_blank">UW</a> to rant a bit about intellectual property issues.  Today <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/" target="_blank">Michael Geist</a> released a short video countering some of the claims about Canada's status as a "piracy haven".  I have no idea how accurate his statistics may be, however many references are cited throughout and Geist is generally considered an expert in the field.<br /><br /><center><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6TloG6qL3gg"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6TloG6qL3gg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></center><br /><br />The clip is about eight minutes and touches on movie and music piracy, as well as the counterfeit product racket and Canadian anti-piracy activities.  As most current copyright news is coming from our neighbors to the South these days it's nice to get a local update.
