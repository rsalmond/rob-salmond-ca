This weekend I setup a Google Reader account for my mother. I figure if she can use RSS, you can too.  So checkout my sidebar for the feeds that I'm munchin.<br /><br />Work on cheapdrunks is moving ahead well.  I've booked next week off from ze cubicle for a last push to get things ready for a Sept 1st open beta.  I've also moved from tracking work on a wiki to <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>.  So far I like it.  Dead easy to use and everything is where you'd expect it to be.  I dunno jack from project management and I get the feeling this thing is gonna help a lot.
