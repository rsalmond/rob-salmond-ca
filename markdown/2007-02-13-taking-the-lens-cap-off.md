My cousin <a href="http://web.mac.com/evansdavid/iWeb/Site/About%20the%20Photographer.html" target="_blank">David</a> emailed the fam recently to announce his departure from the world of the slaggin it for a wage into the land of self employment. One of the directions he's opted to move in is to market his photography skills, starting with several <a href="http://web.mac.com/evansdavid/iWeb/Site/Albums.html" target="_blank">collections of photos</a> gathered during his travels. Most of my exposure to his photo albums has been family history related, so it was a nice change to get a look at some of his more artistic work ...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/content/images/2007/02/david_evans-soussesvlei_namibia.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5031014295668158370" border="0" /><br />(a shot of Namibia from Davids Africa series)<br /></div><br /><br />I got to thinking that I'm pretty well stocked in the friends with cameras department, and more than a few of them get to some interesting locales.   My buddy Matt spent a year in Tokyo with his girlfriend a while back, teaching English and learning to hate ducking.  He's back in the Great White North as of last year and back at school but <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/xocet/" target="_blank">his pics</a> still lurk in the tubes.<br /><br />My friend Paul currently lives in Tokyo and also has some shots of the city as well as several collections of Japanese parks, mountains, and the obligatory pagoda shots over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmundt/" target="_blank">his Flickr account</a>.  He also gets a fair bit of travel done in the course of his work and posts pics as time allows.  His recent set of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmundt/sets/72157594524082238/" target="_blank">shots from Sydney</a> show some interesting Eastern architectural influences there that I was completely unaware of.<br /><br />On the local scene my friend Mike keeps a running tab of his photos of friends, trips, and of course Toronto at <a href="http://shadowfind.ca/photoblog/" target="_blank">shadowfind.ca</a>.  He'll be doing some traveling in the spring and is looking into an underwater case for his cam so stay tuned for more goodness.<br /><br />Also both my parents have amassed a decent collection of JPEGs in recent years, Mom having picked up a nice SLR to match her journalistic tendencies and Dad keeping his cameras handy while flying at some fairly exotic locales for a geophysical survey company.  However since neither of them have embraced the magic of the interwebs I have no links to offer ... (hint hint!)
