<span style="font-family: Arial;">As a teenager I spent some time living in a small city on Vancouver Island with around thirty thousand people. &nbsp;Even as a youngin' I had an unhealthy appreciation for all things apocalyptic. &nbsp;Road Warrior, The Stand, Swan Song, pretty much anything Of The Dead. &nbsp;If most of humanity was gone, I was paying attention to it. &nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;">One weekend morning in my small city I had to be downtown early for some reason and on my way there as I crested a hill that overlooked the city center I realized I could not see or hear any evidence of another human being anywhere. &nbsp;There were no cars moving anywhere, no boats in the channel, no people in my line of sight. &nbsp;Just me and a big empty city. &nbsp;It's a strange feeling, scary and liberating at the same time, like the first time you sneak off in your parents car.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I saw this short video today and it reminded me of that morning. &nbsp;Enjoy! </span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="300" width="400"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11986171&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11986171&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></div>
