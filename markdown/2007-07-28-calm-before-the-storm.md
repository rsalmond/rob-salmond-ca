No posts in a while.  I've been busily munging together some bits and pieces for a site dedicated to all you miserly drunkards out there (you know who you are).  I've got a half decent working model put together that still needs some love, but if all goes well it should be good to go for the fall.  For the time being you can get a pretty basic idea of whats going on over <a href="http://cheapdrunks.ca/" target="new">here</a>.
