Guy One: Man I've been sick for like a week and a half now.<br /><br />Guy Two: Oh yeah?<br /><br />Guy One: Yeah I've been hacking up all this nasty jell-o stuff.<br /><br />Guy Two: Oh yeah? What colour are we talkin here?<br /><br />Random dude in a tie is horrified.<br /><br />Guy One: Oh man like green radioactive waste colour.<br /><br />Guy Two: Yikes, you sit and watch that stuff?<br /><br />Guy One: What the nuclear waste? No I didn't watch it, why?<br /><br />Guy Two: Ya gotta watch it for a minute y'know, make sure it's not moving. If it's moving you should see a doctor.<br /><br />Dude in a tie and woman pretending not to hear both squirm.<br /><br />Guy One: Ahhh you're right, could be like a nasal tapeworm or something.<br /><br />Guy Two: Yeah.<br /><br />Guy One: Yeah.<br /><br />Me: lol.
