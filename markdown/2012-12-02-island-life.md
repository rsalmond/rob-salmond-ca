I've been on Vancouver island for a while now and am starting to get back into island mode. After visiting some old friends the weekend I arrived my grandad who's been here twenty years broke his ankle walking his new puppy and asked me to stay at his place and help out a bit while he mended up. So I spent &nbsp;about a month in a little place called Youbou helping to housebreak Cleo. It was a nice break after the pace of the ride and gave me a chance to quickly stitch together <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYv3fJZzGGI">some of the extra videos</a> I hadn't uploaded from the trip.<br /><br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2012/12/IMG_20121102_111829.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2012/12/IMG_20121102_111829.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">(cute puppy is cute)</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Once the cast was carved off and my dad rolled into town after finishing up work and travelling a bit I figured it was time to keep on keepin on so I made my way back to Victoria to set up shop. I've been here a couple weeks checking things out, getting the lay of the land, and carpet bombing the city with resumes. I've also tracked down a bunch of old friends, some I haven't seen in fifteen years! Lots of catching up to do, plenty of marriages, kids, and careers going on in the intervening years to hear about. &nbsp;My old room mates Chris and Stacey kids have done that thing wee ones do and gotten quite a bit bigger since we last met up. And more hilarious.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2012/12/IMG_20121125_164309.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="/content/images/2012/12/IMG_20121125_164309.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">(Austin rocking a merman look)</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'm not quite settled into a routine yet, but I've got more interviews coming up this week and should be well on my way to hunkering down for the winter with a gig and a crib that don't involve&nbsp;pedalling and tent poles before too long. In the meantime, the sky is blue and I'm gonna go find a part of town I haven't explored yet ...</div>
