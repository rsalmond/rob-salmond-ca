Well despite my heartfelt emails Santa brought bills this year instead of a nice flatscreen TV. So I threw out sanity, payed the bills and bought some thingys for the fam and invited them here instead of heading home. I've seen my mom make a roast before, it didn't look <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> hard ...<br /><br /><br /><a href="/content/images/2007/12/Photo-60.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/content/images/2007/12/Photo-60.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5147802580442315170" border="0" /></a><br />Maybe after new years I'll put a fish tank here instead.<br /><br />I hope you find yourself warm, well fed, and in good company today :)
