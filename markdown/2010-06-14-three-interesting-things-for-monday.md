Here's a few interesting things to help you either distract yourself from your week or take it head on. Your call.<br /><br />1. Instead of spending eternity in an urn or perhaps as <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/09/55231">an artificial diamond</a>, how about as a piece of 3D printed art?  Perhaps, <a href="http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/10256/wieki-somers-consume-or-conserve.html">a tableau of a couple birds and a toaster</a>?<br />- <a href="https://twitter.com/UnlikelyWorlds/statuses/16141067901">gracias</a><br /><br />2. I've yet to find any groundbreaking research at <a href="http://www.zacharyburt.com/">Zachary Burt's blog</a>, but his well metered explanations and summaries of past and current psychology research have prompted me to put a few things on my reading list. &nbsp;His three part series beginning with <a href="http://www.zacharyburt.com/2010/06/the-science-of-compliance/">"The Science of Compliance"</a> gets the point across by citing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini">world renowned professor</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddox_(writer)">world renowned jackass</a>. &nbsp;My kind of article.<br /><br />3. By far the most interesting thing I discovered by reading <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/06/geopolitics-in-the-raw.html">Charlies post today about Afghanistan</a> was <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/05/27/once_upon_a_time_in_afghanistan?page=full">this article by a man who grew up in Kabul "in the 50's and 60's"</a>. &nbsp;He describes the city he remembers and provides a series of photos of impressively bouffanted ladies and brylrceemed men working and studying in what looks like any western city of the era.
