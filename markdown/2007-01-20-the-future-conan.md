A number of interested parties seem to think its somehow their business what my plans for the days ahead might include.  To these nosy types I say sod off!  However it has been my experience that people don't just up and sod off when you tell them to, so for the persistent folks out there who want to know what I'm doing with my time these days scroll down and browse my calendar.  I try to keep my work schedule (a rotating shift at a 24/7 datacenter aka "the cube")  current at the very least, so check here if you need to reach me.
