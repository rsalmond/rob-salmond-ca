I really like digg.  I read it a lot, I like diggnation, etc etc.  I was checking out the winning entries of the recent <a href="http://digg.com/contest" target="_blank">API contest</a>, and spotted a runner up called <a href="http://diggcontest.com/wordweb/" target="_blank">WordWeb</a>.  It visualizes the links between "commonly occurring keywords" in digg stories.  The default setting uses only words grabbed from front page stories which at that moment had a lot to do with Cheney.
