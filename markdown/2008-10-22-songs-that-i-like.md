I would never ask you to <a href="http://isohunt.com/download/16427169/the+strokes.torrent">like my music</a>, but if you do that's just fine with me.<br /><br />"I'm tired of everyone I know,<br />of everyone I see<br />on the street<br />and on TV.<br />On the other side,<br />on the other side<br />nobody's waiting for me.<br />On the other side<br />I hate them all.<br />I hate them all.<br />I hate myself for hating them,<br />so I'll drink some more.<br />I love them all.<br />I'll drink even more.<br />I'll hate them even more<br />than I did before.<br />On the other side,<br />on the other side<br />nobody's waiting for me.<br />On the other side.<br />I remember when you came,<br />you taught me how to sing.<br />Now it seems so far away.<br />You taught me how to sing ...<br />I'm tired of being so judgemental<br />of everyone.<br />I will not go to sleep.<br />I will train my eyes to see<br />that my mind is as blind<br />as a branch on a tree.<br />On the other side,<br />on the other side<br />I know what's waiting for me.<br />On the other side.<br />On the other side,<br />on the other side<br />I know you're waiting for me.<br />On the other side."
