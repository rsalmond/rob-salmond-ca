Hey all, checking in from Neys Ontario, somewhere between Marathon and Schreiber on the North shores of Lake Superior. Since I've been out of touch online I've been shooting videos with my phone to try to keep y'all posted but it's turning out to be really tough to learn a new video editing suite and get stuff uploaded while biking all day and camping all night.<br /><br />I promise I do have some fun stuff to show as soon as I can sit still for a few hours near some decent high speed bandwidth and get things posted. In the meantime, here's Brent and I looking very stressed about our grievous lack of broadband.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2012/07/IMG_20120709_171745.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="/content/images/2012/07/IMG_20120709_171745.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2012/07/IMG_20120709_171809.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="/content/images/2012/07/IMG_20120709_171809.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
