Some friends and I were chatting while bringing a few things from their car up to their apartment last night, and having a heated debate when suddenly, shit got <i>real</i>.<br /><br />him: Oh yeah?<br /><br />me: Yeah!<br /><br />him: Wanna bet? &nbsp;How much?<br /><br />me: Umm ... no?<br /><br />her: Ohhhh, suddenly he doesn't sound so sure!<br /><br />him: See as soon as there's money he thinks I'm right. &nbsp;Surprise surprise!<br /><br />me: Whoa hey wait a minute, I never said I think you're right.<br /><br />him: So, let's put some cash on it big guy.<br /><br />me: No see because I suspect I may be wrong, that's not even close to thinking you're right. &nbsp;Different things entirely.<br /><br />him: You're an idiot.<br /><br />her: *nods*<br /><br />I stand by my flawless logic.
