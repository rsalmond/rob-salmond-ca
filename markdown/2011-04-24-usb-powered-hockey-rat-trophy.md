Yeah you read it right.<br /><br />Yesterday my dad and I were making our tipsy way home after watching the Jays take a beating at my local bar. &nbsp;On the way in we saw what I guess someone who'd been moving had left by the service entrance to my apartment, boxes and miscellaneous junk. &nbsp;I saw a weird rat statue with a USB cable sticking out of it and thought, whoa, USB powered rat! <br /><br />Hell yeah!<br /><br />So I grabbed it and said to pop and&nbsp;incidentally to a neighbor who was waiting for the elevator; "Yo check it out, USB rat statue!"<br /><br />Dad: "Um, cool?"<br /><br />We step into the elevator.<br /><br />Girl: "Er, are you sure that's not just a rat statue with a USB cable hanging on it?"<br /><br />Me: Pulling a random USB cable free of rat statue, "Um, nope".<br /><br />So now what do I do with a non USB powered rat hockey trophy? &nbsp;Suggestions welcome.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2011/04/hockey_rat.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="/content/images/2011/04/hockey_rat.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>
