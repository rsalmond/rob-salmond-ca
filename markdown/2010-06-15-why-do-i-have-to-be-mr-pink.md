I enjoyed this interesting video yesterday by <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Dan Pink</a> and then today I was randomly linked to a recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_pink_shirky">Wired article</a> which is basically a dialogue between him and <a href="http://shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>,&nbsp;creator of the brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky#The_Shirky_Principle">Shirky principal among other things</a>.&nbsp; When I trip across the same interesting person twice in as many days I usually take that as a sign that I should be paying attention. If you work for someone, or have someone who works for you, or both, then I think both this video and the article are worth a moment of your attention too.<br /><blockquote><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Pink: </b>" ... When Deci took people who  enjoyed solving complicated puzzles for fun and began paying them if  they did the puzzles, they no longer wanted to play with those puzzles  during their free time. And the science is overwhelming that for  creative, conceptual tasks, those if-then rewards rarely work and often  do harm." </div></blockquote><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u6XAPnuFjJc&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u6XAPnuFjJc&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div>
