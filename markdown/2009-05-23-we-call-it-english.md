When I first watched the compelling <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/hedonistic-company">Lift08 talk by Holm Friebe and Philipp Albers</a> last year I was quite hopeful. I thought; Here's a couple guys plugging a book they published (in Deutsch) two years ago at a conference that's getting them a lot of international press, there's bound to be an English translation soon!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;q=%22Wir+nennen+es+Arbeit%22+%22english+edition%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">Not so</a>.<br /><br />Admittedly if I'd known it was going to take this long I'm sure I could have learned quite a lot of German in the fifteen odd months since I heard about these guys, so poo-poo on me for lack of effort. But Lift09 has come and gone with the gents of the <a href="http://www.zentrale-intelligenz-agentur.de/">Zentrale Intelligenz Agentur</a> <a href="http://www.tiburon-tv.com/2009/03/05/holm-friebe-philipp-albers-zentrale-intelligenz-agentur-lift09/">appearing again</a> and I still can't seem to find a copy of <a href="http://wirnennenesarbeit.de/">das buch</a> in englischer Sprache. Can anyone point me in the right direction or should I be dragging my lazy ass down to the Learning Annex in lederhosen?<br /><br />Bah, anyway you should watch their talk. Maybe if they get more hits from this side of the pond some clever multilingual person will get to work enlightening our grubby North American minds with some forward thinking ideas on the nature of work.<br /><br /><div align="center"><br /><embed style="WIDTH: 400px; HEIGHT: 326px" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" hl="en&amp;fs="></embed> </div>
