I've spent the past six months living and working in Victoria at <a href="http://oceanisland.com/">a very chill place</a> which I am a bit sad to say goodbye to. As it stands my work there is done and a month or so ago I began looking for something new to do with my time. A fella I met while touring last summer invited me to join him on <a href="http://www.watchmyback.ca/">his next adventure</a>, riding from Nelson BC to Dawson City Yukon. I gave it a lot of thought but in the end decided it was time to return to work before my edge was too far gone to get back.<br /><br />With that in mind I cast about at a handful of places in Victoria and in Vancouver looking for something nerdy to do with my time and a place called <a href="http://www.appneta.com/">AppNeta</a> made me the most interesting offer so I've made my way to the mainland and tomorrow I'll be heading in to the first "real" work I've had since I left the bank last May.<br /><br />I figure any company that has a three foot wide ball of ethernet cable hanging from the ceiling and concerns themselves with inquiring about a potential employee's foosball prowess is the sort of place I'd like to spend my time.<br /><br />In a bit of random topic change, I noticed that bicycle trailers were very popular in Victoria however the whole time I was there I think I saw maybe one store bought trailer on the road. The rest were crazy home brew&nbsp;concoctions&nbsp;that had me wondering why I'd spent so much money on mine in the first place. After a few weeks of seeing these things rolling around the city I decided to start cataloguing them for posterity. Here are a few of the more interesting ones ...<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130107_061903.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130107_061903.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130121_173134.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130121_173134.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130126_122326.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130126_122326.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130209_173952.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2013/05/IMG_20130209_173952.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">(I guess the symbols are for ... safety?)</div><br />So that was my winter an a very small nutshell. Summer time in Vancouver should be interesting. As it happens I discovered I know more than the one person here I thought I did, an old friend noticed my location change on facebook and invited me round to meet for a BBQ this afternoon so I'm about ready to locate a few beers and make my way over to meet some new folks and gnosh some grilled goodness. Hope your Sunday afternoon is even better than mine promises to be!
