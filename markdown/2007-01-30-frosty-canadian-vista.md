So my friend Snuffy passed a link along about a Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/wow/icehouse.mspx" target="_blank">event</a> going on in the city to promote Vista, so I strolled up there today over lunch to have a look at the setup. They had it stocked with shiny gadgets and very Canadian looking PR folks sporting Vista toques and singing the MS theme song. There were heaters inside but I was glad to have mitts.<br /><br />Anyway standard marketing speak was going on, the ice crapper was pretty much fantastic, and there was an MS Office(R) compatible toaster on site.  I missed out on the free hot chocolate however, so I supplemented with a barley and hops related approach to the rest of the afternoon.
