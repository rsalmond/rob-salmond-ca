A while back I mentioned a strong desire for a combination of beers and guitar hero to present itself. As it happens about a month ago that happened. While scoping out a cheapdrunks bar called Bistro 422 I met a guy named Craig who told tales of such a place here in town. The rumor was that the Chelsea Room on Dundas W. had GH2 every Wednesday night as well as $3.50 drinks.<br /><br />So naturally, we rallied the troops and hauled our asses down to check it out. Its definitely <span style="font-style: italic;">on</span> at the Chelsea Room. Drinks are indeed cheap and the rock is projected onto a mighty large wall. Hump-day will never be the same again!   I'm off tonight at 11, plan to be there with the Rock Sauce flowin by 11:30 :)<br /><br />Obligatory Facebook group photos <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2450472581">here</a>.<br /><br />Also on the topic of gaming, Interplay is talking Fallout MMO. <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=6829&amp;Itemid=2" target="_blank">OhPleaseOhPleaseOhPleaseOhPleaseOhPlease!</a><br /><br />UPDATE (Jan 24/08): GH at the Chelsea Room will be coming to a close in about three weeks, with work being done to get a Rock Band night happening.
