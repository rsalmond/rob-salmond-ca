This fact doesn't stop me referring to the original as my favorite zombie film of all time however, nor will it staunch my anticipation of the hungry undead retribution to be wrought in the May 11th sequel.<br /><br />The bit that really caught my eye was some talk of an upcoming <a href="http://www.atomicbooks.com/products/-/9902.html" target="_blank">graphic novel</a> to be released at the end of this month.  Its been ages since I made my way to y'olde <a href="https://www.silversnail.com/default.html" target="_blank">silver snail</a> with something other than a gift on my shopping list, methinks I'll treat myself.<br /><br />Oh yeah and if <a href="http://www.cinematical.com/2007/03/14/mad-max-4-announced-mel-gibson-will-not-star/" target="_blank">Mad Max 4</a>, <a href="http://www.bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_071204.htm" target="_blank">Fallout 3</a>, and the <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/15/new-line-to-remake-escape-from-new-york/" target="_blank">Escape From New York</a> remake ever get released then my post apocalyptic fiction nirvana shall be complete!
