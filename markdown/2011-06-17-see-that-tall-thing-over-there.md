For almost seven years I've worked about thirty seconds away from the CN Tower. &nbsp;Most of the time I don't pay it much attention, it's just background. &nbsp;Sometimes tourists will ask about it and remind me it's there though. &nbsp;Once in front of Union Station two french sounding girls asked me where the tower was. &nbsp;I pointed at it over a building and said; "walk towards that until you can see the bottom, then go in".<br /><br />Then I heard about this platform they're opening this summer and I thought yeah that sounds cool, it's pricey but cool. It was initially described like this.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2011/06/this.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="254" src="/content/images/2011/06/this.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Crazy edge dangling: check. &nbsp;But then I saw this. &nbsp;What that hell is this?<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJy-t_yc9l8"><br /><img border="0" height="195" src="/content/images/2011/06/this2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />No crazy edge dangling? &nbsp;Meh. &nbsp;Not sure if want. Yo CN Tower, you wanna make money with less safety equipment? &nbsp;Hack your LED's into a pressure plate and rent out a gravity hammer! &nbsp;Worlds biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_striker">high striker</a>? &nbsp;Um, yes!<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulobar/1273774476/"><img border="0" height="640" src="/content/images/2011/06/awesome-tower.png" width="571" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(actual amount of awesome)</div>
