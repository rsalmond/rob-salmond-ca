My buddy Nic (<a href="http://twitter.com/Ogcin">aka ogcin</a>) relaunched both <a href="http://www.nicgo.ca/">his personal blog</a> and his Toronto Raptors site TheRapSheet last week. I think he got an itch he needed to scratch when he discovered that former voice of the Raptors <a href="https://twitter.com/swirsk054">Chuck Swisky</a> (now calling/writing for <a href="http://twitter.com/bullsnews">the Bulls</a>) was following him on twitter.<br /><br />I'm not much of a sports fan but Nic invited me out to a Raptors game earlier this year and I had a surprisingly good time so I'm starting to pay a bit more attention to this world of "basketball" people keep talking about.<br /><br />So if your a Raps fan point your browser <a href="http://www.therapsheet.ca/">yonder</a>, it's good and it's free!<br /><br />edit: While you're there wish him a happy birthday, that dude is OLD tomorrow!
