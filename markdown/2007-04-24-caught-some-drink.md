Seems my friend Joe got <a href="http://www.thestar.com/Life/article/206280" target="_blank">some words</a> printed in todays Toronto Star, I'm all famous and stuff.  Before I heard about the article some guy found me on facebook to get a list of locales for $2.50 drinks.  I knew being a cheap bastard would get me somewhere one day.  So for the record it goes Wednesday - Croc Rock, Thursday - "Joe" or "My Apartment" (unconfirmed, is this still around?), Friday "Philthy McNasty's" or "The Phoenix", and Saturday - "Afterlife" (rarely worth the effort).  Also my brother introduced me to the "Done Right Inn" on Queen West a while back.  They have reasonably priced sauce all week, won't give a rats ass if you stick gum on the counter, and have a quiet back patio that'll finish off any summer evening.<br /><br />Welcome back summer!
