I spent the weekend back home with ma' but Saturday night as the fam was turning in for bed I decided to head out and meet some friends from school for a few pints and some catching up.  What follows is a conversation that happened outside the pub while my friend finished his smoke and some dude walked up to us ...<br /><br />Some guy: "Hey guys, think I could grab a cigarette?"<br /><br />My friend: Hands him a smoke.<br /><br />Some guy: Proceeds to search his pockets for a light without success. <br /><br />My friend: Rolls his eyes.<br /><br />Some guy: "Erm ... think I could get a light too?"<br /><br />My friend (handing him a lighter): "So you want a lip and a lung to smoke it with too pal?"<br /><br />Me: rofl.
