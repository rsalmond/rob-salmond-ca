What the hell joost, you were cool while I knew ye ...  For the past couple weeks I've been suffering from this '<a href="http://www.joost.com/forums/p/2007/06/upgrade-server-not-available/">upgrade server not available</a>' crap on the macbook.  Fortunately a bell guy showed up a couple weeks ago to remove the VDSL filter that was cutting out my internet connection.  While he was working I asked how far the CO is from the building and the good news was "here".   Apparently this place is only a couple years old and is built on the site of a <a href="http://www.fybush.com/site-020905.html">CBC broadcast station</a> which would make it a great location  to house some recently upgraded infrastructure.<br /><br />At any rate the intartoobs are moving much quicker, and I'm cooking up a couple ideas to make use of the bandwidth.
