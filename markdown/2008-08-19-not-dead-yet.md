I've moved across town.  I've got a new job.  I've had quite a few couch surfers from far away lands holed up in the rob-icile.   I'm heading to the West coast of this fine country to attend the wedding of my eldest younger brother to his high school sweetheart.  It's been a very busy summer and it shows no signs of letting up any time soon.<br /><br />I'm spending too much time behind a keyboard and / or in a bar (or both), and not enough time in the sun.  But fear not, the rumors of my death have been wildly exaggerated.<br /><br />In the meantime I'll leave you in the excellent company of one of my new found friends-a-la-intarweb, one Mr. Ron Jenkees.  When I was a young man it was only angry music that could sate my yearning soul.  Today I want <span style="font-style: italic;">happy</span> and I want lots of it, and my boy Ronnie has happy in spades.  Thanks to you Ron and thanks to those still watching this space.  Enjoy the tail end of your summer.   I sure will :)<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0O2aH4XLbto&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0O2aH4XLbto&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object>
