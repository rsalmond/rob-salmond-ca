I've been meaning to take the new blogger theme editor out for a spin but kept playing with it to make something uniquely mine&nbsp;and discovering that under my tender ministrations a unique site theme is also a butt ugly one. &nbsp;So I decided to leave that to the pro's and use this stock template with some minor layout modifications and methinks it'll do quite nicely.<br /><br />As for the new plans they are twofold. &nbsp;One being that I have recently rekindled my love of Crazy Schemes (tm). &nbsp;Not much to say on that other than I am very much enjoying filling my free time with scheming and tinkering and will have more&nbsp;on that later.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme"><strong>Marge</strong>: Homey, what are you going to do? </a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme"><strong>Bart (fingers crossed)</strong>: Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme... </a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme"><strong>Homer</strong>: Get me tools and beer! </a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme"><strong>Bart</strong>: YES!</a> </div><br />The other thought is&nbsp;that I find myself often thinking something interesting that is too short to be post worthy but too long to express in a tweet. &nbsp;With that in mind I'm going to be&nbsp;making an effort to put shorter things in this space more frequently, perhaps in a similar format to my last "<a href="http://phrostuff.blogspot.com/2010/05/thinks-i-thunk.html">thinks i think</a>" post.
