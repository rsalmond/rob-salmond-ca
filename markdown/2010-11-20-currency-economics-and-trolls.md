I recently read on the <a href="https://www.pirateparty.ca/forum/index.php">Pirate Party of Canada forums</a> that the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> has begun accepting donations in the form of <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoins</a>, a form of digital currency that's seen some steady growth of late. &nbsp;I read a little about Bitcoin when it&nbsp;<a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/11/1747245/Bitcoin-Releases-Version-03">popped up in my newsreader</a> in the summer but having little understanding of either cryptography or economics my interest wandered quickly. &nbsp;When I read through the replies however it seemed some people had strong concerns about such a currency being widely adopted, and one vocal protester seemed well informed on the subject so I began "discussing" it with him. &nbsp;My mistake.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2010/11/must_not_feed_the_troll.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/content/images/2010/11/must_not_feed_the_troll.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(the troll, do not feed it!)</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">After a bit of back and forth it became clear that my troll was either unwilling or unable to provide a sound argument for any of his positions that didn't eventually fall back on ubiquitous corporate evil doing and one world governments. &nbsp;Still interested, I took my&nbsp;curiosity&nbsp;to <a href="http://www.usdn.ca/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=1&amp;topic=1259">another forum I frequent</a> hoping to find some well reasoned opinions on the matter. &nbsp;During the discourse that took place there I was directed to an interesting <a href="http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/fetters_gold_paper.pdf">paper describing the failure of gold backed currencies</a>, educated about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">Nixon Shock</a>, and the foolishness of engaging trolls. &nbsp;(A friend who works in parliament messaged me on Facebook later to advise I run and don't look back "They're all kooks. Flee!").</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Normally the story above wouldn't wind up here, but I've included it because since then with a bit of economy on the brain I've been paying more attention to such topics while surfing. &nbsp;There seems to be a lot of interest in&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;open economic models lately that strike me as interesting if a bit over my head. &nbsp;For the curious, here's a brief <a href="http://shareable.net/blog/the-new-mutual-credit">overview of some of the concepts</a>, a <a href="http://shareable.net/blog/gen-y-the-future-of-money">short video about money, wealth, and creation of value</a>&nbsp;including links to several projects in the problem space, and a free book + wiki&nbsp;<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/wealth_of_networks/Main_Page">"The Wealth of Networks"</a>&nbsp;about the influence of social production on markets.<br /><br />Also worth checking out; <a href="http://www.dyndy.net/">DYNDY</a>. &nbsp;I still haven't worked out exactly what it is, but they seem to be sniffing out and examining all manner of alternative and complementary currency systems. &nbsp;Check out <a href="http://www.dyndy.net/2010/11/launch-at-ecommons2-in-de-balie-amsterdam/">this post</a> for an overview of a presentation about themselves at a recent conference in Amsterdam.<br /><br />I really have no idea what all this buzzing might mean if anything, but I do find it intriguing. If you have any suggestions about reading material pertaining to backed vs fiat economics or alternative models please drop a comment. I am vastly under informed on the topic and would like to change that.</div>
