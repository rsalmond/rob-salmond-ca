Well it took a bit longer than expected but after fiddling with DNS updates and installing a couple basic customizations I've earned my stay at the <a href="http://www.ironbridgemotel.com/">Iron Bridge Motel</a>. The owners Mark and Kathy are happy with the results and are looking forward to adding new catch of the day photos to the blog. When I arrived Mark told me about his computer abilities, "If I can't fix it with a hammer I don't mess with it". Now he's blogging and keeping a close eye on his Google search status!<br /><br />Marks brother Pat and friend Adam arrived yesterday, they&nbsp;caravanned&nbsp;up bringing Marks "mistress" home from storage. We went out for a cruise in this beastly Wildcat, great way to travel in style!<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/content/images/2012/06/IMG_20120629_175140.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="/content/images/2012/06/IMG_20120629_175140.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />So we celebrated her triumphant return with some BBQ and some cold beers, great end to a great week. Tomorrow I make for Sault Ste Marie and hope to find something interesting to do for Canada day!
