I snagged a cheap ride at the island (nuts to <a href="http://communityair.org/home.htm">the whiners</a>, an airport downtown is a mighty convenience) and grabbed a quick visit and a tour of <a href="http://www.sgl.com/">the office</a> which was pretty cool.   The liquid cooled gravity meter was pretty wild looking, they keep it in a tea cosy though which adds an odd grandmotherly look.  Good little visit before he's off to work in a Peruvian summer for another couple months, try not to have too much fun<br /><br />I had a few hours to roll around the city while he straightened out some last minute stuff at work and while I was looking around I managed to photograph the elusive Canadian crackspider!  Fortunately I kept my cool having been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHzdsFiBbFc">previously alerted</a> to the dangers of the crackspider and how to avoid becoming its bitch by my well prepared friend Anneveld, thanks Anne.
